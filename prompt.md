help me use rust implement features describe in README_EN.md.
you need follow below steps
1. analyze features you need to implement with current code version and generate todo list append to README_EN.md todo section
2. you need promise these generate code is clean enough and full comment why and if you need design pattern just use it
3. you need implement implement core logic with a interface or trait in rust first then implement logic 
4. write some log output to file for we can check errors info
5. generate unit test for these logic feature with interface or trait
6. you should write some changelog and use git commit changes after you complete a feature and fix compile errors
7. if you think features need external service .you can generate a docker compose to describe and use it to e2e test final
9. you should feedback README_EN.md todo section after complete test then git commit changes
8. if you repeat a errors just ask me
