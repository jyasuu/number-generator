help me use rust implement features describe in README_EN.md

you need follow below steps:
1. analyze features you need to implement with current code version and generate todo list append to TODO.md todo section
2. you need focus on one todo implement core logic with a interface or trait in rust first then implement logic 
3. generate unit test for these logic feature with interface or trait
4. you should write some changelog and use git commit changes after you complete a feature and fix compile errors
5. if you think features need external service .you can generate a docker compose to describe and use it to e2e test final
6. you should feedback TODO.md todo section after complete test then git commit changes



you should promise follow below rules:
1. code is clean enough and full comment for why 
2. use design pattern and comment pattern name
3. write some log output to file for we can check errors info
4. if you repeat a errors just ask me
